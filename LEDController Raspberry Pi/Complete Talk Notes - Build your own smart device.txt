Build your smart device.

Introduction:
  Hi everyone, This is Aswin Prasad. I am here today to give you an introduction about IoT and then a quick session to build your IoT device using Raspberry Pi, sensors, a little bit of programming, and finally I will talk about the possibilities of what can be done further with IoT.

  The session contents will be available in our materials library website, feel free to use the website to get access to the video and references mentioned in this session and the github link for the project will also be there.

Introduction to the Internet of Things:
  Simply saying, the Internet of Things is a concept in which there will be physical devices that are connected to the internet and they collect data from or output data to the world. These devices include everything from phones, smartwatches, smart home devices. Many devices that once had only physical interfaces are connected to internet and are part of Internet of Things.

Pre-requisites:
  There are some things that you will require to replicate the following experiment, feel free to change some parts as per the experiment you want to do.
  1. Raspberry pi 3/4 with Micro SD card and Raspian OS loaded.
  2. LED. (For this example, feel free to experiment with some other sensors too.)
  3. Jumper wires.
  4. A monitor to use as a display along with HDMI cable to work with Raspberry pi.
  5. Slight relevance to programming.

Building your smart device: (Will be elaborated during the actual experiment)
  1. I am going to explain to you how you can create your device. For this, we are going to have a web page, which will be used to control an led bulb.
  2. The bulb can be either switched on or off based on the user input in the computer.
  3. What are the parts in it (Web page to give the user input, Node Server update file based on user input, Python to control Raspberry Pi's io ports to control light).
  3. Play the video.
  4. Open the Code files and explain the parts in it.

Other project ideas:
  The Internet of things doesn't stop here, there are endless possibilities of what can be done with IoT. You can build an automatic light control for your house, thermostat for your house that can be controlled with your homes, etc...
  You can always get these devices in Amazon, but building them yourself with these sensors will give a sense of understanding and satisfaction for anyone who does that.

Caution:
  One word of caution for takeaway from this session, Don't connect electric devices directly along with your IoT setup as the system we are developing is not tested thoroughly and can cause harm to life and property. You can try small utilities that interest you.
