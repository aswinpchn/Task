This was a task I got from a company for internship.

Requirements:
1. The task is to Use PDFJs to create a webapp that displays PDF's and has controls for pdf view like Zoom, scroll etc.
2. The task has to be done with VueJs as frontend.
3. Consider that the PDF's are already stored in the server. (The utility package I used is some package called 'fs' to retrieve folders from server. )
